          <p>
            All data aggregations are computed dynamically using Vega-Lite transforms. The choropleth map uses 
            Equal-Earth projection for area-accurate representation. Normalized stacking reveals proportional 
            distributions independent of absolute volumes. Dual-axis encoding separates magnitude from rate comparison.
